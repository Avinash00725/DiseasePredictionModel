In this project,I had collected some of the datasets from the Kaggle regarding the disease prediction and then performed one-hot encoding on each column value and then based on the target value (0/1) the disease is predicted.
- In order to implement this model I had used XgBoost algorithm and got a good accuracy in order to predict the model.
- Some of the diseases like asthama,cancer,diabetes and stroke datasets are been tested using this XgBoost Model.
